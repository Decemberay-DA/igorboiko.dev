State: Closesd.

Closing notice: Originally this project was for my diploma. I have passed diploma with this project successfully and had desided to rewrite OOP like game engine to FP like. I have done it. Then I red some clevr -> clever articles and figured out that FP that I got is not the actuall -> actuall FP. I was just about to start to rewriting this FP like game engine to FP like game engine but 100000+ red errors tells me to stop -> quit. 

Feeling a profound sense of disillusionment with both myself and humanity I thought "I shall stop rewriting things if I want to deliver a stuff". With that in mind, I stopped working on this project and started a new one.
