# problems
 - here are a IDinamicUpdate and collection of IDinamicUpdate (IDinamicUpdates) 
    - can be handeled in simpler way by inheriting from smaller model-like classes
 - interfaces IDinamicUpdate and IEnableable are separete but second shall affect first one when thay are combined
    - add type check in executing of IDinamicUpdate
    - or in constructor create different versiob for different components configurations
 - maybe i need root referenced thing like identity(ID<Self>) that everything will reference to 
 - probably launch everything in test scene will be a good idea before coding more


ok, unitian gameobject/component system making some sence now
